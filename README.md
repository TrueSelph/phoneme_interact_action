## How to Use

Below is detailed guidance on how to configure and use the Phoneme Interact Action.

### Overview

The Phoneme Interact Action provides an abstraction layer for managing phoneme-based prompting. It supports multiple configurations for various use cases, including:

- **Custom phoneme mappings** for specific words.
- **Integration** with text-to-speech engines.
- **Dynamic phoneme editing** via the app interface.

---

### Configuration Structure

The configuration consists of the following components:

### `phonemes`

Defines the phoneme mappings for words, where the key is the word, and the value is its phonetic representation.

```python
phonemes = {
    "example": "…™…°Ààz√¶mp…ôl",  # Example in IPA
    "data": "Ààde…™t…ô",        # Example in IPA
}
```

---

### Example Configurations

### Basic Phoneme Mapping

```python
phonemes = {
    "hello": "h…ôÀàlo ä",
    "world": "w…úÀêrld",
}
```

### Best Practices
- Validate phoneme mappings for compatibility with your TTS engine.
- Test configurations in a staging environment before production use.
